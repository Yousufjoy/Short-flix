Here’s a shorter version:

---

This project uses **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Next.js API Routes** for backend logic. The codebase is kept simple and modular. With more time, I’d improve validation, error handling, and folder organization. I used **Claude** and **ChatGPT** mainly for quick UI help, while the core logic was built from my own experience.

**How to run:**
Clone the repo, install dependencies, then run:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```
