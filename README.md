This project uses **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Next.js API Routes** for backend logic. The codebase is simple and modular. With more time, I’d improve validation, error handling, and folder structure. I used **Claude** and **ChatGPT** mainly for quick UI help, while the main logic was built from my own experience.

**API Route:**
`GET https://short-flix-chi.vercel.app/api/shorts`

**How to run locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yousufjoy/Short-flix.git
bun install
bun run dev
```
